Based in Colorado, I am a software engineer working for [Paramount+](https://github.com/icahoon-cbsi), primarily using golang, and interested in o11y and k8s.

Away from work I enjoy traveling throughout Colorado with my wonderful wife, playing games (video and tabletop), and programming [side projects](https://arcadium.dev) to keep current with new technology. Having fun with flyio, influxdb and sqlite.

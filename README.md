Based in Colorado, I am a software engineer working for [Paramount+](https://github.com/icahoon-cbsi), primarily using golang, and interested in observability and kubernetes.

Away from work I enjoy traveling throughout Colorado with my wonderful wife, playing games (video and tabletop), and programming [side](https://arcadium.dev) [projects](https://github.com/arcadium-dev) to keep current with new technology. Having fun with flyio, influxdb and sqlite.

You can find me on <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@icahoon">hachyderm.io</a>.
